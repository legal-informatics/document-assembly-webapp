        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            A motion to indict, or a private lawsuit, contains the following:<br/>
            1) first name and surname of the defendant with personal data, if known;<br/>
            2) brief description of the offence;<br/>
            3) statutory name of the criminal offence;<br/>
            4) name of the court before which the trial is to be held;<br/>
            5) proposal of the evidence to be presented at the trial, specifying the facts which are to
            be proved and with which of the proposed pieces of evidence;<br/>
            6) proposal of the type and severity of the criminal sanction and measure whose
            imposition is being sought.<br/>
            A motion to indict, or a private lawsuit may contain a motion to place the defendant in
            detention, and if the defendant was in detention during the implementation of evidentiary
            actions, the motion to indict shall specify the time spent in detention.<br/>
            If on the basis of collected evidence the public prosecutor deems that a trial is
            unnecessary, he may request in the motion to indict that a hearing for the imposition of a
            criminal sanction (Article 512) be scheduled.
